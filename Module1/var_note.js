var carName; //Out of fashon/ former primary but it caused errors/bugs in complex code due to not considering scope.//
let carName; //currently the preferred method. It's a step forwards from var declarations because let variables have unambiguous scope.//
const carName = "constant"; //Constant values are maintained for variables declared with the const keyword. Let declarations and const declarations have some similarities.//
//Warning, consst can't const cannot be updated or re-declared.//
//  This signifies that a variable declared with const has the same value throughout its scope.//
